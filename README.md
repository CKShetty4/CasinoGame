Get ready for a side-splitting good time at the casino that won't leave you empty-handed (well, maybe figuratively). This unique program, built entirely in C, ditches the fancy graphics for a collection of hilarious text-based games that will test your luck and tickle your sense of humor.

## **Dive into a world of wacky entertainment:**
-  **Number Hunt** : Can you pinpoint the hidden number between 1 and 10? Prepare for witty exchanges as you home in on your target.
-  **Number Ambush** : Dodge the relentless onslaught of numbers before they overwhelm you! This fast-paced game will keep you on the edge of your seat (or chair).
-  **Coded Danger** : Navigate a minefield (built with C code, no less!) in the terminal environment. Hilarious descriptions and unexpected twists will keep you guessing until the (hopefully) safe escape.
-  **High Card (2 player game)** : Challenge a friend to a battle of wits! Both players secretly pick a number, and the one closest to the target number emerges victorious. Prepare for some playful jabs and bragging rights.
-  **Snake and Ladder (2 player game)** : Relive your childhood memories with this classic dice game, reimagined with a humorous twist. Roll the dice and navigate the board, but beware of the mischievous snakes and helpful ladders!
-  **JackPot** : Feeling lucky? Pull the lever on our wacky slot machine and see what zany combinations await you!

Remember the house rules!
While we might not break the bank, we'll definitely test your comedic sensibilities. Manage your deposits and withdrawals according to the lighthearted rules, and focus on the laughter, not the loot.

This is pure terminal magic waiting to be unleashed!
